## Test Configuration

The tests are configured to run against `https://app.qa.cboard.io` by default. This can be modified in `playwright.config.ts`.

### Browser Support

- Chromium (Chrome)
- Firefox
- WebKit (Safari)
- Mobile Chrome (Pixel 5)
- Mobile Safari (iPhone 12)

### Features

- Automatic screenshots on failure
- Video recording on failure
- Trace collection for debugging
- Parallel test execution
- Cross-browser testing

## Best Practices

The tests follow Playwright best practices:

1. **Role-based locators**: Using `getByRole()` for better accessibility testing
2. **Auto-waiting assertions**: Using `expect().toBeVisible()` and similar assertions
3. **Avoiding strict mode violations**: Using `.filter()` when needed
4. **Proper test isolation**: Each test is independent and can run in parallel
5. **Page object pattern**: Not implemented yet but recommended for larger test suites

## Test Data

The tests use the actual production-like environment at `app.qa.cboard.io` and test real user workflows:

- Communication building scenarios
- Navigation patterns
- Accessibility requirements
- Mobile usage patterns
- Security feature validation

## Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines with:

- Retry mechanism for flaky tests
- Proper reporting
- Artifact collection (screenshots, videos, traces)
- Multiple browser testing

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing naming convention
2. Use descriptive test names
3. Include proper assertions
4. Test both positive and negative scenarios
5. Consider accessibility requirements
6. Test across different viewport sizes
7. Ensure tests are isolated and can run in parallel

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tests timing out**: Increase timeout in config or use more specific locators
2. **Flaky tests**: Add proper waits and use more reliable locators
3. **Cross-browser failures**: Check for browser-specific behaviors
4. **Mobile test failures**: Verify touch interactions and viewport settings

### Debug Tips

1. Use `--headed` mode to see what's happening
2. Use `--debug` mode to step through tests
3. Add `await page.pause()` to stop execution at specific points
4. Check the test report for screenshots and traces
5. Use browser developer tools in headed mode
